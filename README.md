# Log2Console

Log2Console is a development utility which provides an easy-to-use UI allowing to filter and search for log messages from the following logging services: Log4Net, Log4j and NLog. It can directly receive log events locally or remotely, or read them from a log file. 

<div class="note">It will also be included into Cinegy Archive Service installer starting from version 11.</div>

To organize logging over UDP via Log2Console, the relevant parameters should be configured on both CAS and Log2Console sides.

Please refer to the <a href="https://open.cinegy.com/misc/log2console/"><b>Log2Console</b></a> article for comprehensive explanation of logging over UDP via Log2Console.
